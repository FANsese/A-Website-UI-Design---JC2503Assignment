                    <h2>Foreword</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Interest</h3>- this word seems to be none of my business for me in the past.
                    
                    <p>
                        I used to be a boring person - I was not good at sport that many of my classmates 
                        playing, and I even not playing online games that really famous then. I just concentrate 
                        on study (and I didn't get a good grade nevertheless), my only 'hobby' is playing piano - 
                        for level examination. All of this made me unpopular at that time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I remember my first real sense of interest is playing Rubik's cube. It was about ten years
                        ago, I was watching a reality show called 'Super Brain'. I was really fascinated when 
                        I saw that tiny cube, brimming with vibrant colors, dancing on the players' hands and
                        witnessed them racing against time to solve the cube in the competition.
                        It was impossible not to be impressed by the speed and excitement they displayed, so I begged 
                        my parent to buy one then. Unexpectedly, I grasp some of the basic solutions quickly, and by 
                        playing and teaching others playing the cubes, I made a lots of friends and met many 
                        like-minded people, which made me more out-going. From this, I finally realized how interest 
                        mean to a person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So far, though I play cubes less and this is not my main interest, I have many other 
                        interests now. But that colorful cube that once illuminated the lonely child always 
                        reminds me: the richness of life does not lie in chasing what others consider "hot", 
                        but in cherishing those moments that make your heart race - it can be the moment that witness the 
                        successful operation of the programs one has written day and night, it could be a moment that 
                        captures all the magnificent scenes in an instant, it could be the freedom that soaring in the 
                        sky... I finally realized: The essence of all of the interest, whether mediocre or not, is 
                        the gentle measurement of the possibilities of life.

                        Trying to make one's main job or main thing to study as an interest is not an easy task. 
                        When coding is mentioned, my memory always goes back to the time when I was learning 
                        in a robot club in junior high school. The language we learnt then is Arduino, and that 
                        was my first time I get in touch with code programming. Because I'm not good at 
                        abstract thinking, writing code has always been a painful experience for me. For that, 
                        at that time, I thought to myself, I would never, under any circumstances, engage in 
                        any work related to writing code in the future.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>
                        But later, the outcome was just like it is now. Due to various reasons, I was 
                        assigned to the Software Engineering major. For a student like me who has almost 
                        no foundation on coding, catching up courses is usually not easy, especially in the 
                        first year of university. This case was altered a bit in the first summer holiday of 
                        university. I was taken to my uncle's home for some further study, and I learned some 
                        really different things there, like linear prediction and training some prediction 
                        model. The tasks he gave were really hard for me, but after I tried my best and finally 
                        solved them, a sense of achievement always arises, and I finally discovered the 
                        interest of programming.

                    <p>
                        For now, coding really becomes one of my interests, especially writing html codes - it's 
                        really a very fulfilling thing that under one's own editing, the content of the page becomes 
                        increasingly rich and the style becomes increasingly beautiful. The coordinate system that once 
                        got lost in the error messages of Arduino was finally re-anchored by CSS selectors. When the gradient 
                        color gently blends within the arc of border-radius, one realizes that those "!important" that make 
                        the page tremble are merely the predestined fates that fate has already set.

                        Though from the time when I was in primary school I start to frequently shoot 
                        some landscape and other thing, I suppose it was right after I finished the high 
                        school entrance examination that I began to take photography as a hobby.
                        At that time, I spent almost all of my pocket money - I spent nearly six years saving it, 
                        to buy a GoPro8. That was my first photography equipment in the real sense. 
                        In the following five years, till now, I've buy a lot of different photography 
                        equipments, and also sold many of them, but since this gopro means too much for 
                        me, though it has almost no shooting ability anymore due to the aging of the 
                        components, I still keep it.

                        And here's a group photo of all my photography devices!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes when I looked at them, I can't help but sigh - these devices have 
                        accompanied me to so many places, witnessed and recorded so many gorgeous sceneries.
                        In their memory cards, there are the azure blue of the countless lakes in Jiuzhaigou, 
                        the endless emerald green when crossing the mountains and ridges, the dark grey of the 
                        reinforced concrete structures in the city center, the warm yellow that covers the sky 
                        in the morning and evening... There is the dance of the bird wings captured in 8x slow-motion 
                        during the moment when the migratory birds fly; and there is also the alternation of 
                        day and night condensed into 5 minutes during my high school renovation project, which lasted 
                        for a month... The metal coating on the shutter button has turned into the shape of a river 
                        changing its course, while the lens coating is revealing the latitude and longitude patterns 
                        of the Gobi salt lake crystals. The memory card counter is still recording the geological 
                        sedimentation rate for all the dusk that has not arrived.

                        Except simply shooting photos, I also shoot videos somethmes. Occasionally when I'm in 
                        the mood, I may choose a topic, get out to shoot some video, edit them together, and post 
                        on some social platforms like Moment or Video Channel on Wechat, on Bilibili and so on.
                        Though few people watch them, I still make them, to enjoy the process of making a video.

                        Nowadays, I often place my equipment on the table, treating it as a piece of decoration. 
                        These things are now quietly lying on the desk charging, like a group of soldiers who have 
                        just taken off their armor - the UV filter of the Canon lens still retains the coldness of 
                        the mist on Mount Emei, the red button of Action4 has been soaked with the salty and dampness 
                        of Palawan Beach in Singapor, and each scratch on the carbon fiber blades of the drone is still 
                        remembered as the wind speed when flying with the flock of migratory birds over Jiuzhaigou. 
                        Sometimes, when cutting clips late at night, I suddenly notice that the so-called love is just 
                        sharing the same set of vital signs with these metal objects: They remember all the shapes of 
                        light for me, and I am responsible for finding a coordinate system for those lost pixels to 
                        return home.

                        During the summer holiday before I began my high school life, I get my first drone - a 
                        Mavic air 2. Getting it is truly a dream-level thing for me since before that I really want 
                        a drone so bad, eagering to see what the world looks like in the sky. I remember the first 
                        time I got it in my hands, I carefully opened the package, read the instructions carefully, 
                        and couldn't wait to go to an open area near my home to conduct a test flight. My mood at 
                        that time could be described as excited, because it meant that I could observe the world from 
                        a new perspective.

                        When the intelligent hovering function of the drone could no longer accommodate the ambition 
                        of soaring through the clouds, I began to explore the concept of FPV drones - I was truly 
                        fascinated by that sense of freedom of soaring freely in the sky. After I accidentally 
                        encountered a very cheap FPV drone package half year ago, flying a FPV drone became my latest 
                        interest.

                    <p>
                        Unlike normal aerial drone, the threshold for getting started with fpv drone is high. The full 
                        manual operation determined the difficulty of controlling it, so for most people, to control it 
                        properly and to do some stunt flight action, practicing the operation on the simulator for at least 
                        one month is a must. Since it may easily broke down when crashed under high speed of flying, mastering 
                        basic welding, assembly and parameter adjustment skills is also necessary. By flying fpv drones, I 
                        not only enjoyed the happiness to fly freely and sense accomplishment for successfully doing some 
                        flight action, but also I grasp some relevant hardware knowledge.

                        While the intelligent hovering algorithm of the Mavic Air 2 was still meticulously weaving a perfect 
                        geometric map in the cloud, my neurons had already begun to deconstruct the grammar of gravity - those 
                        spectral fragments torn apart by the snowflakes of the FPV goggles, those motor parameters tempered at 
                        the melting point of solder, eventually teaching me: True flight is never the solo dance of the drone, 
                        but rather a fugue composed jointly by the carbon fiber framework and the dopamine neural synapses. Each 
                        circuit board re-welded after a crash is a philosophical argument submitted by humanity to the three-dimensional 
                        space; Each dizzying experience of crossing the clouds is a comma trembling in the decoding of Einstein's 
                        field equations by the physical body.

                        Though from the time when I was five I began to play piano, and most of the time then I mainly 
                        dealing with classical music, whether it is playing or appreciation, but at that time I seldom 
                        listening music for relaxation or for interest. Until when I was eleven, I was encountered a rhythm game 
                        called Rolling Sky. The background music was really fascinate me then, and I think that's precisely how 
                        I began to really fond of music, especially electric music. When it comes to my favorite type of music, simply saying 
                        "electric music" might be too general. For me, Future Bass and Melodic Dubstep are the music styles that I like the most.

                    <h3>Future Bass</h3>
                    <p>While the twelve-tone equal temperament of classical music still adheres to the contrapuntal rules on the piano keys, 
                        Future Bass has used the acoustic chaos of sawtooth waves and square waves to open up the quantum world of sound for 
                        me. This music genre that emerged in 2006 uses a resonant frequency of 120-145 BPM to transform human voices into 
                        digital-era lyric poems. Its sound design is revolutionary - through LFO control of the filter to create a "flashing 
                        sensation", it is like putting nebulae into the matrix of a synthesizer. Canadian producer Far Out's "Constellation" 
                        is a perfect example of this aesthetic: he injects the anime-like cuteness of Kawaii Bass into the framework of house 
                        music, like using neon beams to draw a MÃ¶bius loop on the sound spectrum, creating a sonic landscape where sweetness 
                        and chaos coexist.</p>

                    <h3>Melodic Dubstep</h3>
                    <p>
                       When one desires a more intense mental tremor, Melodic Dubstep (Melodic Echo Bass) becomes the antidote to my soul. 
                       As a branch of Dubstep, it retains the intense Wobble Bass of Brostep, but grows the softness of a harpsichord within 
                       the sonic cracks. The American musician ILLENIUM's "Fractures" perfectly embodies this contradictory aesthetic: When 
                       the violent fragmented beats pound the chest cavity, the soothing melody emerges from the cracks in the sound wall, 
                       like transparent roses blooming in the ruins of a nuclear explosion. This "existence of both brutality and healing" 
                       trait is like weaving a lullaby with steel bars - when the 430Hz screeching bass and the female vocal chanting resonate 
                       at opposite ends of the spectrum, the Cartesian coordinate system of the physical world completely collapses, and the 
                       auditory experience transforms into a function of the ratio of dopamine and melatonin.

                        <p>From Chopin's nocturnes to the vocoder of Future Bass, from Beethoven's "Symphony of Fate" to the pulsating bass of 
                            Dubstep - my musical journey is essentially a revolution in sensory topology. When Far Out uses side-chain compression 
                            to create rhythm pulses like those of a space capsule docking, and when ILLENIUM plants transparent flower buds in the 
                            sonic ruins, they are all proving that the essence of all music is the gentle mapping of infinite possibilities by humans 
                            using limited technology.</p>
